                  <h2>Interest in IT</h2>
                    <p>
                        I am 28 years old and currently work in hospitality.  I speak both German and English and am currently living in Germany, where I have been for the last two years with my partner. I grew up in Melbourne and my main hobby is making electronic music and building furniture.
                       </p> 
                    <p>
                         My interest in IT began at around 21 when I started making electronic music. I found I really enjoyed the technical side of the programs I was using, rather than just the music itself. I wanted to know how these programs created the sound and allowed me to make music, I wanted to know what made them tick. Until recently that was the extent of my interest in IT, until recently. I made friends with a programmer from New Zealand, living in Germany, after having lived in Bali for 6 months (during the initial stages of the pandemic), the whole time working remotely as a web developer for a New Zealand based company. I was immediately interested in how he had such freedom, and financial security, as well as job satisfaction. After meeting him I became very interested in programming and IT.
                       </p> 
                    <p>
                        I have had friends who have studied at RMIT in the past and have enjoyed the experience, and had really good things to say about the faculty and culture there. I took a web development course online at RMIT and enjoyed it. Though canvas was initially a little frustrating, I soon got used to it and figured this would be a decent way to do a bachelors degree, the first year of it anyway. </p>
                    <p>
                        I hope to gain a greater understanding of the wider professional world of IT. I really have next to no experience with this environment. I hope to find something closer towards the programming side to work in as I love to build things and be creative, something closer to the design/UX side of programming and IT really appeals to me. But it’s still early days yet and I am open to all possibilities. However I am more looking forward to the programming side of my studies. I am hoping to gain a ‘decentish’ understanding of at least a few programming languages while studying here.

                    This is a remote based role for an online hotel booking company that is not only involved in the building of apps but also involves the UX side of development. First and foremost this job is fully remote, meaning I can perform this role from almost anywhere in the world, at the very least from anywhere inside of Europe, allowing for a far more flexible lifestyle than a traditional office job. The UX aspect of this also greatly interests me, I enjoy design, improving and working on design reviewing and streamlining design, the entire process is something i seem to really enjoy.
I have a basic understanding of React (it was my introduction to the world of coding) and seem to really connect with that style of programming, but my knowledge is VERY remedial. I have a strong interest in software design and testing those designs.  However, all of the experience and an effective, usable knowledge of the tangible skills involved are things I am lacking. 
In order to be eligible for this job a much deeper knowledge of React would be necessary. Resources like Codecadamy and the React website would be great places to start. From there, building apps myself and slowly building a portfolio of work would be my next step. I have always been someone who learns best by actually doing.

                  <h3>Myers-Briggs: Mediator, INFP-A/INFP-T </h3>
                  <p>  
                      Deeply empathetic, supportive and non judgmental. Although they know the world will never be perfect, Mediators still care about making it better however they can. This quiet belief in doing the right thing may explain why these personalities so often inspire compassion, kindness, and beauty wherever they go.

                      You understand and remember things by sight. You can picture what you are learning in your head, and you learn best by using methods that are primarily visual. You like to see what you are learning.

                    The results aren’t too much of a surprise to me. I do disagree with some aspects of the results, for example I feel I can at times be quite judgemental of people in regards to certain things but not others, and the Myers Briggs test said that I was not judgmental at all. On the whole, I feel personality tests are simple and restrictive things attempting to accurately gauge something that is inherently massively complex (a person) and filled with motivations and reasoning a simple test could never possibly gauge. I tend to view them as something more akin to astrology than any useful tool. But if I was pushed for an answer I wouldn't want to be put in any sort of working group solely filled with people wanting to be the leader, as I feel this would create a lot of conflict. However, I found the learning style test to be somewhat useful to me. I feel confident I can use the information on my visual learning style to improve my study and workflow, with tools such as flash cards.

                  <h2>Project Idea</h2>
                  <p>
                      An app that matches asylum seekers with people willing to share their home free of charge, or at the very least free of rent. Functioning somewhat like a cross between a dating app, and AirBnB or Couch Surfer, but geared towards people who have extra space and are willing to lend it to those who need it. Both hosts and person seeking asylum would create a profile with some personal information, age, location ect, while also detailing each situation. The  app would then match the person seeking asylum with a list of potential hosts. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I currently live in Berlin, a popular destination of people seeking asylum from all parts of the globe for a myriad of reasons. Obviously recently the war in Ukraine has seen millions of Ukrainian citizens fleeing the country, many with the goal of comg to or through berlin. Those without family or connections have been left to rely on the city for overnight accommodation as they move through Berlin, or having to rely on overwhelmed organisations hoping they can find an apartment to stay in for the short to medium term. This situation is not unique and not new, yet still, those seeking asylum are usually put in the precarious position of relying solely on overwhelmed and mostly grossly underfunded aid organisations to find accommodation for them. This app would help provide an avenue for autonomy and ease the pressure in searching for a safe space.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The prospective host would sign up to the app and fill out a profile. This profile would contain personal information like age, gender languages spoken, and a photo.They would then detail the space available including..<br>
                       - Who else lives in your house/apartment with you<br>
                       - Square metres of room and rest of house/apartment<br>
                       - If an apartment, what floor the apartment is on and if there is a lift or not.<br>
                       - Parking regulations in the area if no personal parking space is available<br>
                       - If it is a shared space or not, and how much of the space ie kitchen, bathroom is shared<br>
                       - If the host is requiring a split on the utilities<br>
                       - If and what bedding/seating/furniture is available<br>
                       -  Whether or not the space is sufficiently heated or cooled <br>
                       - Other various quirks and or physical attributes to the space being made available<br> 
                       
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The Host would then enter the details of who they are willing to accept into their space and for how long, which would include details such as<br>
                       - The limits to the duration of the stay, be it a limit to the number of days/weeks/months or up until a particular date.<br>
                       - How many people they are willing to host<br>
                       - The various ages of people they are willing to host<br>
                       - If they wish to host a family how many children or if they are willing to host children at all. (This could also work as a lower age limit).<br>
                       - If they feel comfortable or not with hosting men or women or both<br>
                       I feel these options could also be selected as “prefer not” option, where as others could be entered as “hard no” option by the prospective host, and limit on the amount of “prefer not” options could factored in when matching for with other users. 
                        </p>
                    <p>
                    The person seeking an apartment would also fill out a form of personal information stating things like<br>
                      - Age <br>
                      - Photo<br>
                      - Gender<br>
                      - Languages spoken<br>
                      - Who you travelling with, ie if you are travelling with family or not<br>    
                         </p>
                     <p>
                    They would then fill out a form detailing the requirements of the house/apartment you were looking for<br>
                       - Who  you are comfortable living with (much like the above questions given to the host, number of people,if you are comfortable staying with families, if you are comfortable staying with men or women ect)<br>
                       - Whether or not you would need any specific requirements with a potential place to stay, i.e. wheelchair access.<br>
                       - If they are willing or able to pay a share of utilities if staying in the short to medium term<br>
                       - And of course desired location/s<br>
                    Much like the above options for the host, these could be input as a “prefer not” option or a “hard no” option.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The person seeking asylum could then select a single or several locations and view all the  potential hosts whose data/preferences represent the best matches. They could then view the hosts locations much like one would with airbnb, contact them through the app and organise a potential stay, all without blindly relying on a mediary to find a place for them.
                         </p> 
                    <p>
                        In terms of hardware for this project, a computer is all that’s needed to create an app. Software required would be VS Code with create-react-app installed, assuming that the app would be created using React. However I am aware that the coding language Ruby is at least partly used for a lot of apps, including Airbnb, that incorporate much of the same features i am describing, but my knowledge of Ruby is next to none, and is also less commonly used, so it seems somewhat impractical to use.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Obviously for this app to be built someone with experience building apps would have to do it. I have none. I do not currently possess the skills to build it. However, I do have family who have left Ukraine recently, and have friends who have left similar situations in their home countries in order to come to Germany, who I could potentially ask for opinions and thoughts on the app from. It would obviously be imperative to have  input from people who have gone through the experience.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm already in possession of the hardware and software to complete the project, however the Feasibility of making the app, assuming I'm doing this alone would probably be out of reach for me currently, at least at this moment, due to my lack of experience and skills. But I'm sure it wouldn't be out of this world to think I could at least make it part of the way, if I were to attempt a far more simplified “directory style” system.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The outcome of this could potentially mean that those who find themselves in a country where they have no family or connections, who are seeking asylum, have an avenue to look for temporary accommodation for themselves. And those that are willing to share the extra space in their apartment or house have an easy, quick and  accessible way to do so. It also has the potential to ease the burden on aid and refugee organisations, who often end up being the sole mediaries to find accommodation.
